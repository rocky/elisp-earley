;;;  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; A parser takes three inputs: a grammar, a lexicon (perhaps defined
;; with regular expressions), and a tokens to parse.  This parser then
;; returns a parse tree.
;;
;; Earley Parsers are often also called "Chart parsers", because every
;; time the next token in a sentence is read, that a new chart is
;; created.  Each chart contains a set of "states" that roughly
;; correspond to rules in the specified grammar that are in different
;; states, depending upon what input has already been seen.

;; The Earley Parser algorithm starts with exactly one chart, with the
;; starting state. With this it "predicts" the next states. Through
;; "prediction", "scanning" and reduction more states get added to
;; this initial chart.  At some point a token is encountered which
;; triggers a scan, which in turn causes the chart-index to be
;; incremented, and the next set of states that are created are added
;; to a new chart.  This continues, where new charts are created and
;; states are added to each of those charts.  A list of charts is just
;; a list of a list of states.
