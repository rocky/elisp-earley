Here we have some sample grammars.

We use the `.g4` extension to indicate a grammar file. This extension
seems to be what ANTLR uses. Our syntax right now is a bit limited
and different.

Comments in grammar start with `#` or `//` at the beginning of a line
and the comment spans to the end of the line.
