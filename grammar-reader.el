;; The context free grammar representation is a hashtable keyed on non-terminal
;; symbols. For each symbol there is a list of productions/rules for that
;; symbol. The productions take the form of a ordered list of symbols.
;;
;; The non-terminal symbols are represented as strings.


;; The lexicon is the representation of all terminal symbols (words in the
;; language). It is a hashtable keyed on word. For each word there is a list
;; of "terminal" structures that are different semantic mappings of the word.
